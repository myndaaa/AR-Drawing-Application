# AR Drawing App

**AR Drawing App** is a tool that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to overlay drawings on top of the camera view. It is designed to help users draw with precision by providing a real-time guide. This app is built with **Flutter** and uses **SQLite** for local data storage.

## Features

- **AR Drawing:** Use AR to project drawings onto a real-world surface via the camera.
- **Custom Drawings:** Choose from preloaded images or upload your own to use as a drawing guide.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Controls for positioning, scaling, and rotating the guide image.
- **Offline Capability:** SQLite integration ensures that all data is stored locally.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Manipulate the AR image to align perfectly.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The app is built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).
- **SQLite**: For local storage of user data and drawings.
- **ARCore / ARKit**: Depending on the platform (Android or iOS), the app leverages ARCore or ARKit for augmented reality functionality.
